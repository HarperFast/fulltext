# @harperfast/fulltext

Native Tantivy full-text indexing for Node.js, with a native filesystem backend and a planned
Harper integration backed by Harper's existing RocksDB storage APIs.

This repository is under active development. The native entry point provides a standalone Tantivy
index backed by `MmapDirectory`. Harper releases will use only the planned Harper entry point; it is not exported yet.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.18 or newer, or Node.js 24 or newer
- Rust 1.90 when building from source

The package never compiles or downloads native code during installation. A supported prebuilt
artifact must be present for the executing platform.

The initial CI-qualified targets are Linux x64 glibc, macOS arm64, and Windows x64. Additional
targets are added only after their artifacts are loaded and tested on the target runtime.

## Native usage

```js
import { encodeMutationBatch, openNativeFullTextIndex } from '@harperfast/fulltext/native';

const index = await openNativeFullTextIndex({
	path: './search/products',
	indexId: 'products',
	generation: 'v1',
	fields: [{ name: 'title', weight: 3 }, { name: 'description' }],
	analyzer: 'english@1',
	limits: {
		indexingThreads: 2,
		searchThreads: 4,
		writerMemoryBytes: 60_000_000,
		maxQueuedCommands: 128,
		maxQueuedBytes: 64 * 1024 * 1024,
		maxBatchBytes: 8 * 1024 * 1024,
	},
});

await index.apply(
	encodeMutationBatch({
		upserts: [{ id: 'shoe-1', fields: { title: 'Trail running shoe', description: 'Waterproof' } }],
	}),
);
await index.commit();
await index.reload();
console.log(await index.search({ text: 'waterproof running shoes', limit: 10 }));
await index.close();
```

Mutation batches are versioned packed values, so indexing crosses Node-API once per batch rather
than once per document. One dedicated actor owns Tantivy's single writer for each index. A bounded
search pool shares immutable searchers and can execute reads while indexing or commit work is in
progress. Queue limits reject overload with `E_QUEUE_FULL` rather than blocking the JavaScript
thread.

Search uses BM25. `total` is a bounded result by default so Tantivy can retain block-max WAND
pruning. Set `exactTotal: true` only when an exact match count is worth a second full-match
traversal. `positions` defaults on for future phrase queries; `surfaceTerms` defaults off because it
stores source text for future highlighting and suggestions. Both settings are persisted and must
match when the index is reopened.

`close()` rejects uncommitted data by default. Use `close({ mode: 'rollback' })` to discard it
explicitly. `commit()` publishes mutations, and `reload()` makes the latest commit visible to this
handle's searches.

## Storage boundaries

The delivered storage targets are native Tantivy and Harper:

- `@harperfast/fulltext/native` is implemented and uses Tantivy's native filesystem directory.
- `@harperfast/fulltext/harper` is planned. It will use Harper's shared derived-index runtime and
  persist index state through Harper's existing RocksDB storage APIs.

There is no supported standalone rocksdb-js backend or planned rocksdb-js peer dependency. The
fulltext addon does not bundle RocksDB. Harper owns its storage dependency version and lifecycle,
and never falls back to native Tantivy files.

The next milestone proves the real Harper storage path, bounded threading, durable publication and
crash/reopen behavior. The experimental native-lease branch remains unmerged and is not a release
dependency. See [Harper storage integration](docs/harper-storage-integration.md) for the architecture,
proof obligations and native-versus-Harper benchmark plan.

## Development

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build:debug
npm test
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run benchmark:native -- --documents 100000 --concurrency 4 --commit-every 25000
```

The benchmark generates a deterministic, high-cardinality product catalog and emits one versioned
JSON record. It reports packing, apply, durable end-to-end ingestion, actor queue and execution
time, commit distributions, reload cost, warm and cold BM25 p50/p95/p99, exact-total overhead,
index bytes, and periodically sampled process RSS. `--commit-every` sets the target number of mutations between
durability points; it materially affects throughput and peak memory because replacement-safe
upserts include delete terms. CI runs only the correctness smoke profile; timing comparisons
require controlled hardware.

Generated Node-API declarations in `ts/addon.d.ts` are private implementation types. Consumers use
only the types exported from a package entry point.
